# Hacker News - Increase your chances of being ranked on the front page

The Hacker News website is a servicable platform where users interact with each other, typically through sourcing information or in the form of posing a formal question. A single posts non discriminant to the type of post will be ranked. `The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story was submitted. Comments in threads are ranked the same way. Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account or site weighting, and moderator action.` Given the system Hacker News uses to support its community, our analysis will be based off the part of the algorithm dealing with comments. 

In this project the data will be used to support its findings and determine characteristics of that model to further assist the community. The idea states that through the findings in the project below, anyone who uses this flatform can receive some valuable information that can affect the value in which they'll receive from others.
