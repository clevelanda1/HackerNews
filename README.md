## About HackerNews

The Hacker News website is a servicable platform where users interact with each other, typically through sourcing information or in the form of posing a formal question. A single posts non discriminant to the type of post will be ranked. `The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story was submitted. Comments in threads are ranked the same way. Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account or site weighting, and moderator action.` Given the system Hacker News uses to support its community, our analysis will be based off the part of the algorithm dealing with comments.
